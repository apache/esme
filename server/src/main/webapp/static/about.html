        ESME (Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment) is a social tool that
        takes the immediacy of messaging and applies it to real time business
        process problem solving. Taking the concepts embodied in social
        networks such as tags and groups, ESME provides the business
        communications framework that allows for the fastest and most reliable
        way of discovering the best solution to everyday problems for people
        working in peer and extended networks. It reduces the risk of applying
        suboptimal solutions by surfacing the right people at the right time
        who can apply expertise to a given situation, allows the participation
        of mobile workers, integrates to existing systems and provides for
        contextually appropriate document attachments.
