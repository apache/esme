    ESME (Enterprise Social Messaging Experiment) is a social tool that
    takes the immediacy of messaging and applies it to real time business
    process problem solving. Taking the concepts embodied in social
    networks such as tags and groups, ESME provides the business
    communications framework that allows for the fastest and most reliable
    way of discovering the best solution to everyday problems for people
    working in peer and extended networks. It reduces the risk of applying
    suboptimal solutions by surfacing the right people at the right time
    who can apply expertise to a given situation, allows the participation
    of mobile workers, integrates to existing systems and provides for
    contextually appropriate document attachments.
