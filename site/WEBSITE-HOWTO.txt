To update the ESME website:

1. Edit content in the src folder

2. Install Apache Forrest V0.8 and run "forrest site" from this
   folder.

3. The generated website can be checked from build/site/en/index.html,
   or use "forrest run" to check it interactively while editing.

4. Use "svn add" and "svn delete" as needed to take into account files
   created or removed by Forrest in the build folder.

5. Commit your changes.

6. Run svn up in /www/incubator.apache.org/esme on people.apache.org
   to activate the live copy of the website. Note that there is a 
   delay (4 hours IIRC) for http://incubator.apache.org/sling/esme
   to be updated once that happens.
